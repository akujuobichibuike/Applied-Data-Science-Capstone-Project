Space Y Capstone Analytics Project (Jan 2023 - Feb 2023)
The Commercial Space Age is here and Space X has a price advantage over its major competitors ($62 million vs. $165 million USD), largely due to ability to recover part of rocket (Stage 1) . Space Y wants to compete with Space X, hence I;
Designed and Developed a predictive machine learning model to predict successful Stage 1 recovery based on data I collected using the Space X API and web-scrapping the Space X Wikipedia page.
Carried out EDA using SQL and visualization
Developed four machine learning models using Python, which had an 83% accuracy.
